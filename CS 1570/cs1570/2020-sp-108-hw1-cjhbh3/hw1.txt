1. Algorithm for modulo division of integer a and b
	a. If a is greater than or equal to b: subtract b from a and set that result to a. 
	b. If a is less than b, do not subtract.
	c. If a is now less than b, that is the modulo.
	d. If it is not, repeat steps a and b.
2. Algorithm for measuring with 8 in. string
	a. Unfold entire length of string across the item
	b. If the string goes longer than the item, fold the string in half to where the length of the string is halved.
	c. If the string is shorter than the item, mark the ending spot and reposition length of string starting at the ending
		point. Mark current length of the string (whether unchanged of 8 or if it has been halved by all) down.
	d. If the string is the exact length of the item, the length is the length of the string currently in inches.
	e. Repeat steps b-d until the item has been fully measured.
3. Algorithm for deciding how to get to class
	a. If weather condition and traffic conditions are okay, moped
	b. If weather condition is bad and traffiic conditions are okay,
		tank
	c. If weather condition is okay and traffic is bad, walk
	d. If weather condition is bad and traffic is bad, tank
