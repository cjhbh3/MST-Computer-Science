# Tips

Make sure you compile all your code and test it wwith test inputs before submitting.  If your inputs aren't correct then you'll lose points!

How to compile: g++ {myfile}.cpp -o {name} or  fg++ if you're  on a school computer
    Note: {myfile} gets replaced with the  actual name of your file and {name} is whatever you want the output file to be called
    Also note: the -o {name} is optional,  and if you don't use it the output file will be called a.out

# Git Help

Some of you may not be familiar with git still, so here are the basic steps:

Clone the repo using the "clone/download" and copy the link in the HTTPS box.
Create a cs1570 folder in your SDRIVE if you don't have one already: mkdir cs1570 and cd cs1570 so you're inside the folder.
git clone the-link-you-copied
This should create a folder called 2020-SP-CS1570-hwX. You can now cd into that folder.
Whenever you create a new file git will track your changes and you can add your file to the repo by doing git add filename.ext

Now we can "commit" our file! You need to add a message with your commit to briefly explain what your changes are. git commit -m "I made a file with my name in it!". The message will show up in your git repo, so be careful of what you write.
Finally you can "push" your changes to the git repo! git push  is all you need to do, it'll ask you to login with your info so once you login you'll be done.
